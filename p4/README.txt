IMORPTANT: I assumed every test file ends with the extension ".ss21" 
ALSO IMORTANT: This program does not run correctly. I had it working at one point 
but I tried to fix a minor error and ending up making a mess out everthing.
I ended up removing a bunch of code trying to fix things and I ended up making
everything worse. I will probably fix all this is future as I want this project to be
part of my resume and I feel I did fairly well on all the previous projects.



to run p4: type "./compfs  [file]"

for example to run p3g1.ss21, type "./compfs p2g1"
