I did option 3, FSA Table is located in scanner.cpp, driver function is in TestScanner.cpp and its called testScanner()

I assume that the token "whole" was typo of while in the instructions.
I assumed that test files will end in .fs 
so to run file: "test.fs" 
	./scanner test
and to run user typed input
	./scanner
